# Changelog

All notable changes to SeedSyncarr are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- Optional encryption at rest for config secrets (API token, webhook secret, Sonarr/Radarr API keys, remote password). Enable via `[Encryption]` section in config; a keyfile is generated on first enable with restrictive permissions.

### Fixed

- Bulk-actions bar now shows "Re-Queue from Remote" when the selection includes deleted files, matching the single-file behavior.
- Auto-delete for multi-file packs waits until every child file is confirmed as imported before deleting, preventing premature deletion when an import is silently rejected.

### Security

- Updated `basic-ftp` transitive dependency to 5.3.0+ to close a denial-of-service advisory (GHSA-rp42-5vxx-qpwr).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- Per-file selection and shift-range select with a bulk-actions bar for Queue, Stop, Extract, Delete Local, and Delete Remote operations on multiple files.
- Dashboard filter with URL persistence: filter transfers by status with state preserved in the browser URL for sharing and page reloads.
- Storage capacity tiles on the dashboard showing local disk and seedbox usage with warning and danger color thresholds.
- New navigation bar with live connection status indicator and notification panel.

### Changed

- Transfer table redesigned with search, pagination, status badges, and progress bars.
- Settings page reorganized into card sections with toggle switches and inline AutoQueue pattern management.
- Logs page updated with full-viewport terminal view, log-level filter buttons, and regex search.
- About page updated with version badge and system information table.
